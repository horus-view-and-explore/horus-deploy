    Reboot the server and wait for reconnection.

    When using a Zeroconf server name (e.g. ``imx6qdl-variscite-som-4F2D7-2.local.``)
    this operation resolves it to an IP address on each connect attempt.
    This allows for devices changing their IP address (e.g. changed network
    configuration) and still reconnect and continue the deploy script.

    Parameters:
        delay: Number of seconds to wait before attempting reconnect.
        interval: Interval (s) between reconnect attempts.
        reboot_timeout: Total time before giving up reconnecting.

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        server.reboot(
            name='Reboot the server and wait to reconnect',
            delay=60,
